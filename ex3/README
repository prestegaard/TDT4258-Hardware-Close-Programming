Build instructions
==================

First, specify the platform and toolchain configurations for the project:

	cd /path/to/OSELAS.BSP-EnergyMicro-Gecko
	ptxdist select configs/ptxconfig
	ptxdist platform configs/platform-energymicro-efm32gg-dk3750/platformconfig
	ptxdist toolchain <path_to_toolchain_bin_dir> 

	
where <path_to_toolchain_bin_dir> is 

/opt/ex3/OSELAS.Toolchain-2012.12.0/arm-cortexm3-uclinuxeabi/gcc-4.7.2-uclibc-0.9.33.2-binutils-2.22-kernel-3.6-sanitized/bin

for the TDT4258 virtual machine. You can ignore the "no toolchain found" error on the third step.

Finally, to build the flashable images, issue:

	ptxdist images

This takes some time now. After ptxdist is completed and you plugged your Gecko
board to your machine, first make sure that the debug mode is set to "MCU".
(Press the "CFG" button under the display, then select "MCU" for "Debug
Control" and save.) Then you can do

    ptxdist test flash-all

to write the built images into the Gecko's flash and boot into Linux.
Note that this uses Energymicro's eACommander which needs 32-bit Qt
installed. See the compendium for more detailed information.
